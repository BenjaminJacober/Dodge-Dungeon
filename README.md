# Dodge-Dungeon
Probably bad coded game.

Important:
- I used Pycharm to create all this code, so its probably easier for you to use Pycharm too.
- You will need a venv.
- You will have to install Pygame.

For the "Planungen" folder.

Important:
- The .ufx file can be looked at and edited via Umlet.
- The other documents are Word files.
